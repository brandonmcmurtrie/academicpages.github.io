I have taught into this course since 2022, first as tutor, then as assistant lecturer, then as lecturer and course co-ordinator. 

This course provides an introduction to philossophy of science, research methods for the social sciences, and statistics for the social sciences. It introduces students to cross-sectional designs, experiments, quasi-experiemtns, descriptive and inferential statistics, and JAMOVI statistical software. 

I design and deliver lectures and labs, administer assignments, organise a team of postgraduate markers, finalise grades, handle pastoral care and special circumstances, etc.
