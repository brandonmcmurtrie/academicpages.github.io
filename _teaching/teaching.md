I am the course co-ordinator for this course.   

This is course builds on the undergraduate psychometrics course I teach, with a focus on organisational psychology. We do another covering of psychometrics, but we also turn to the practical implementation of these tools for use in ogranisations, for selection, performance appraisal, organisational change, etc.
