excerpt: 'Self-report surveys are popular among researchers due to their convenience and, recently, the need for social distancing. However, there is concern that surveys investigating sensitive topics, such as suicide, may cause distress or harm to participants. Iatrogenic harm is any negative effect caused by an instrument, intervention, or treatment. I conducted a scoping review of the studies investigating the potential for iatrogenic harm from survey research. Thirty-seven studies were included. Results indicate that for a small subset of participants, sensitive-topics research can cause some distress. Usually, these participants also report that their participation was important and display a willingness to participate further. However, more randomised controlled trials based on power analyses and using validated psychometric outcome measures are needed.'
