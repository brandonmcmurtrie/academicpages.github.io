Non-Academic
======

* **Venison For Families,	2022-2024.**
 I ran my own small charity through which I donated wild venison to families in need. I donated home-made mince, steak, and sausages. I personally harvested, processed, and packaged the meat. The charity brought in no money or any other material benefit to me. 

* **Army reserves, 5/7 Battalion, RNZIR, Linton Army Camp., 2020-Present.**
 I joined the New Zealand territorial army force (TF) in November 2020, graduating from basic training in February 2021. Since then, I have regularly attended many army exercises, large and small, on-base and in the field.
 I have completed army qualifications in self-defence, weapons handling, safety procedures, first aid (civilian and combat), leadership, etc.
 My discipline, focus, determination, fitness, teamwork, and leadership skills are put to the test regularly in the army.

* **BayGold Ltd.**
 Before transitioning to academia, I was a kiwifruit grower on one of the largest kiwifruit orchards in New Zealand. I spent nearly 7-8 years in the kiwifruit horticulture industry, managing teams of up to 100 workers and their team leaders. I was in charge of developing orchards: taking bare land and converting it into productive orchards.
