I am I final year PhD candidate and social scientist. 

📝 My research interests are in social and political psychology, specifically as they pertain to polarization and group dynamics. 

🧠 Additonally, I am interested in philosophy of science, metascience, open science practices, and the larger project of improving research in social science after its decades-long reckoning with widespread questionable research practices. 

🧑‍🍳 I am also an outdoorsman and a wannabe amateur wild-foods chef, a former 🥝Kiwifruit orchardist at one of the largest orchards in the Southern Hemisphere, and an 🪖infantryman in the New Zealand Army Territorial Force, in the 5/7 Battalion based out of Linton Army Camp.

**Open to work and collaborations**

Though I am currently emplyed full-time as a Lecturer in psychology at Massey University, I am open to additional part-time opportunities—research projects, consulting, or collaborations. 
I have exprience with independent research, project management, survey design and administration, statistical analysis (mostly in R, but also in SAS, SPSS, and JAMOVI), student project supervision, tutoring, and lecturing.
