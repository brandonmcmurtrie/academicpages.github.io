I am I final year PhD candidate and social scientist. 

My research interests are in social and political psychology, specifically as they pertain to polariztion and group dynamics. 

I am also interested in phiolosophy of science, metascience, open science practices, and the whole larger project of improving research in social science after its decades-long reckoning with widespread questionable research practices.  

I am also an outdoorsman and a wannabe amateur wild-foods chef. 

I am currently emplyed full-time as a Lecturer in psychology at Massey University, but I am open to additional part-time opportunities and rsearch projects. 
I have exprience with independent research, project management, survey design, statistical analysis (mostly in R, but also in SAS, SPSS, and JAMOVI), student project supervision, tutoring, and lecturing.

At the C.V. tab you can download my traditional C.V., or you get an overview of my teaching, research, and professional experience right here on the website.
