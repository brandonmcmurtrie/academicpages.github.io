**About Me**

I’m a final-year PhD candidate and social scientist, currently working as a Lecturer in Psychology at Massey University.

📝 My research focuses on social and political psychology—particularly polarization, group dynamics, and identity. I'm especially interested in how psychological and social processes shape ideological divides, and how these phenomena affect wellbeing.

🧠 I also have strong interests in philosophy of science, metascience, and open science practices. I'm passionate about improving the rigor and transparency of research in social science, particularly in the wake of its replication crisis and historical reliance on questionable research practices.

🧑‍🍳 Outside of academia, I’m an outdoorsman and amateur wild-foods cook. I’ve worked as a 🥝 kiwifruit orchardist at one of the largest orchards in the Southern Hemisphere, and I serve as an 🪖 infantryman in the New Zealand Army Territorial Force (5/7 Battalion, Linton Army Camp).

**Open to Collaborations**

Though I’m currently employed as a Lecturer, I’m open to part-time consulting, collaborative research, or side projects. I have experience in:

Independent and collaborative research

Project management

Survey design and administration

Statistical analysis (proficient in R; experienced in SAS, SPSS, and JAMOVI)

Student supervision and university teaching
